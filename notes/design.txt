1. How to identify nested eval statements? I was going to use the eval
   opcode as a reference point, but once inside an eval it gets a little
   nebulous. 
2. How to identify scripts in a way that allows the server directories
   to change? Hashing the whole path makes it brittle, but hashing a
   relative path seems somewhat weaker.
