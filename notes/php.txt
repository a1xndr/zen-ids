The PHP instance to run is php/bin/php.

--------------

The current operation is referenced as OPLINE, which is a macro for
EX(opline), where opline is a zend_op, which is defined in
zend_compile.h. This can be imported. 

Print opcode names using zend_get_opcode_name(), which can be imported.

The best event hook seems to be zend_vm_execute.h:execute_ex().

-------------

*First thing: the initial build requires to remove the php extension "opcode_monitor" from Zend/Zend.m4 (at the end). After building, check out the file again to restore the opcode monitor integration. 

To build php, go to the top-level php directory and:

1. ./buildconf
2. ./current-config # it does this:
      ./configure
        --prefix=$PHP_HOME
        --enable-zend-monitor
        --with-config-file-path=$PHP_HOME/conf.d
        --with-config-file-scan-dir=$PHP_HOME/conf.d/ext
3. make -j3
4. make install

Seems to require bison 2.7, which is not available on 14.04. This
nonsense is corrected by fix-bison (run him as root!):

wget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/140087283/libbison-dev_2.7.1.dfsg-1_amd64.deb
wget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/140087282/bison_2.7.1.dfsg-1_amd64.deb
dpkg -i libbison-dev_2.7.1.dfsg-1_amd64.deb
dpkg -i bison_2.7.1.dfsg-1_amd64.deb


--------------

An extension is defined as struct zend_extension in
Zend/zend_extension.h. There are pointers to various functions for
startup, shutdown, activate, op_array_handler, etc. These are called
with:

  - dispatcher functions zend_list_apply()
  - zend_llist_apply_with_argument() 
  - zend_llist_apply_with_del()

Extensions are initialized in main/main.c:php_module_startup().

----------------

Created extension "opcode-monitor". Build with "./current-config", which
does this:

  > cd ext/opmon
  > ../../php/scripts/phpize
  > ./current-config # it does this:
       configure 
         --enable-opcode-monitor 
         --prefix=$PHP_HOME
         --with-php-config=$PHP_HOME/bin/php-config
  > make -j3
