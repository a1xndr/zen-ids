1. How to canonicalize paths to tolerate changes in the webserver file
   structure?
2. How to identify the execution context generated by an `eval`
   statement?
3. We can statically compile all fragments of script found in files and
   functions (though not eval inputs). Is this a useful way to
   distinguish suspicious anomalies from ordinary ones?
