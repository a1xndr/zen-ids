Opcode ZEND_INCLUDE_OR_EVAL is distinguished by zend_op->extended_value,
which will be one of the constants defined in zend_compile.h:

    #define ZEND_EVAL               (1<<0)
    #define ZEND_INCLUDE            (1<<1)
    #define ZEND_INCLUDE_ONCE       (1<<2)
    #define ZEND_REQUIRE            (1<<3)
    #define ZEND_REQUIRE_ONCE       (1<<4)

Opcodes ZEND_BRK and ZEND_CONT take an integer operand indicating the
number of nested loops to break or continue. In later versions of PHP
the operand is required to be a constant. The target of the CTI is
determined dynamically, so there is no easy way to compile the edge into
the graph.
